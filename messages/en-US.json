Since 1963, Father Doyle served at the then 'Northern Catholic Fellowship Center (旅北教友中心)' (the predecessor of the Catholic Friendship House). He was the head of Friendship House and affectionately known as 'Old Ou' (老歐) by the members. Like a loving father, he guarded this home for the youth 24 hours a day.\nFather Doyle served as the Director of the center until his passing.",
    "lifeStoryTitle": "Brief Biography",
    "lifeStoryContent": "Father Alan T. Doyle was born on March 20, 1937, in New York, to a devout Catholic family.\nIn 1955, he was trained at the diocesan seminary.\nIn 1957, he joined the Maryknoll Fathers & Brothers for missionary work.\nOn June 13, 1964, he was ordained as a priest at the Maryknoll General House in New York. He came to Taiwan in September of the same year.\nIn 1966, he was assigned to Erlin (二林), Changhua (彰化), as an assistant pastor, helping Father Dehui Gao (高德輝神父) with pastoral work.\nIn 1968, he became the pastor of Zhushan (竹山) Catholic Church for three years.\nIn 1972, he studied Mandarin at the Hsinchu (新竹) Language School and helped with pastoral work in other parishes.\nIn February 1974, he served as the Executive Secretary of Catholic Taiwan Missionary Society.\nIn October 1974, he became the Associate Director of the Taipei Catholic Friendship House, and later served as the Director until his passing.\nIn 1987, he established the Maryknoll Language Center in Taipei.\nFrom 1981 to 1991, he served as the guiding priest of the 'Catholic Taichung Auto Repair Vocational School' (天主教臺中力行汽車修護補習班), training automotive repair professionals in Taiwan.\nFrom 1991 to 1997, he was the President of the Taiwan Province of the Maryknoll Fathers & Brothers.\nIn 2014, he promoted the 'Miracle in Cana' religious marriage service, working hard to help Catholics build Christian families.\nOn July 8, 2017, he was granted Taiwanese citizenship for his distinguished contributions to Taiwan and was issued a Republic of China identity card.\nOn May 9, 2021, at 2:48 PM, he passed away at National Taiwan University Hospital.\n\nFather Ou dedicated his life to pastoral work and evangelism, unafraid of challenges and always persevering. He cared deeply for the Northern Catholic youth who had moved away from home, and was passionate about supporting unmarried Catholics in building Christian families. His life of over a century was devoted to the youth of the Taiwan Church, and his devotion never wavered. Father Ou's contributions to the Church in Taiwan cannot be expressed in words, but in our sharing, we remember the moments when his life intersected with ours. Just as Father Ou always upheld: 'Christ is the center of my faith and life.'",

    "introContent": "May the love of God the Father and the grace of Christ be with you always. As we enter our fundraising season, we sincerely appreciate your generous support. Your encouragement remains deeply cherished in our hearts.\n\nThe various pastoral and evangelization efforts of our center, along with the 'Miracle In Cana' Catholic Marriage Ministry, are progressing actively. This initiative has brought new vitality to our center, as young Catholics gather here to build a stronger faith community. Recently, we have also welcomed a new group of young adults in their twenties, further reaffirming our mission: to ignite the fire of faith in young hearts, journey with them in their spiritual growth, and help them find a like-minded Catholic spouse to establish a Christ-centered family.",

    "contentTitle": "When Catholics marry non-Catholics, they enter into a marriage and family life of different faiths.",
    "content": "As shown in the chart above, differences in faith between spouses not only challenge individual beliefs but also lead to inconsistencies in raising children, causing marital tensions and religious indifference. Interfaith marriages often result in the Church losing Catholic families—once considered vital pillars of the faith community. We must not overlook the serious issue of 'Catholic attrition.'\n\nAccording to our research, 60% of unmarried Catholics hope to find a spouse within the Church. Recognizing this need, we have taken responsibility by actively promoting Catholic marriages through 'Miracle In Cana'. Over the past years, we have organized various events for unmarried Catholics, offering a rare opportunity for Taiwan's small 1% Catholic population—scattered across different regions—to meet and connect. However, single events alone, without sustained interactions, are insufficient for fostering deeper relationships. Building meaningful relationships requires time and consistent engagement. Thankfully, our Catholic Friendship House has long provided a nurturing community for young adult Catholics through weekly Masses, regular fellowship gatherings, and monthly activities such as workshops, spiritual retreats, faith formation groups, and outdoor excursions. These settings naturally allow young Catholics to deepen their faith while building meaningful relationships.\n\nThe Catholic Marriage Ministry in Taiwan has grown from humble beginnings to a flourishing movement, bringing forth joyful news of Catholic unions. Seeing new Catholic families being formed motivates us to continue our mission. Currently, 'Miracle In Cana' provides apostolic marriage ministry services, a Catholic matchmaking website, social events for unmarried Catholics, personalized matchmaking services, and educational programs. In addition to these existing services, we plan to expand into central and southern Taiwan to assist more young Catholics in finding faith-based relationships. In an era of rising costs, sustaining and expanding these initiatives requires dedicated pastoral professionals and substantial financial support.\n\nFamily is the cornerstone of the Church. The question of 'Should I accompany my spouse to a temple or go to Mass alone?' remains a persistent challenge in interfaith marriages. Studies show that 85% of Catholics who marry non-Catholics gradually drift away from the Church. This is an urgent matter that requires immediate attention! Strengthening Catholic marriages, supporting unmarried young Catholics, and addressing the challenges facing the Church's future are crucial steps toward fostering a thriving local Church. We must take action! Therefore, we earnestly seek your generous contributions and support.\n\nGive 'More in Depth'— We deeply appreciate your commitment. With your support, we can accomplish even greater things this year!\nGive 'More in Reach'— With financial limitations, we rely on you to spread the word and invite others to become regular donors!\n\nYour recognition fuels our mission forward!\nYour support ensures that 'Miracle In Cana' continues to advance the mission of Catholic marriage ministry without ceasing!",
